# Radiology Report Generator Using Deep Learning and Explainable AI in Indian Languages

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a comprehensive system for generating structured radiology reports from medical imaging data, specifically CT scans, using Deep Learning models and Explainable AI techniques. The reports are produced in multiple Indian languages to enhance accessibility for diverse linguistic backgrounds. The solution includes a multilingual NLP backend, explainable image analysis, and a user-friendly web interface.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Automated radiology report generation from CT images  
- ✅ Multilingual support including Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, etc.  
- ✅ Explainable AI (XAI) integration for interpretability of decisions  
- ✅ Frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS  
- ✅ Backend with Python (FastAPI or Flask)  
- ✅ Pre-trained models (CNN, EfficientNet, ResNet)  
- ✅ Seamless file upload and PDF report generation
